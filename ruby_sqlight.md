Certainly! SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database that is widely used, and Ruby has good support for it through the `sqlite3` gem. Here's a short tutorial on how to use SQLite with Ruby:

1. **Install the sqlite3 gem:**
   Before you start using SQLite with Ruby, you need to make sure you have the `sqlite3` gem installed. You can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   gem install sqlite3
   ```

2. **Require the sqlite3 gem:**
   In your Ruby script or program, you need to require the `sqlite3` gem to use its functionality.

   ```ruby
   require 'sqlite3'
   ```

3. **Open a SQLite database:**
   You can open an existing SQLite database or create a new one. If the file does not exist, SQLite will create it for you.

   ```ruby
   db = SQLite3::Database.new 'your_database_name.db'
   ```

4. **Create a table:**
   You can create a table in the database to store your data. Here's an example of creating a simple table:

   ```ruby
   db.execute <<-SQL
     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT,
       age INTEGER
     );
   SQL
   ```

5. **Insert data into the table:**
   You can insert data into the table using the `INSERT INTO` statement.

   ```ruby
   db.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ["John Doe", 25])
   ```

6. **Query data:**
   Retrieve data from the table using the `SELECT` statement.

   ```ruby
   result = db.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
   result.each do |row|
     puts "ID: #{row[0]}, Name: #{row[1]}, Age: #{row[2]}"
   end
   ```

7. **Update and delete data:**
   You can use the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements to modify or remove data from the table.

   ```ruby
   # Update
   db.execute("UPDATE users SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'John Doe'")

   # Delete
   db.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe'")
   ```

8. **Close the database:**
   Make sure to close the database connection when you're done using it.

   ```ruby
   db.close
   ```

That's a basic overview of using SQLite with Ruby. Remember to handle errors appropriately and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
