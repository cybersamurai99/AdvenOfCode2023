Certainly! Python has a built-in module called `sqlite3` that provides a simple interface to interact with SQLite databases. Here's a short tutorial on how to use SQLite with Python:

1. **Import the sqlite3 module:**
   Start by importing the `sqlite3` module.

   ```python
   import sqlite3
   ```

2. **Connect to a SQLite database:**
   You can connect to an existing SQLite database or create a new one. If the file does not exist, SQLite will create it for you.

   ```python
   # Connect to an existing database or create a new one
   connection = sqlite3.connect('your_database_name.db')
   ```

3. **Create a table:**
   You can create a table in the database to store your data. Here's an example of creating a simple table:

   ```python
   cursor = connection.cursor()

   cursor.execute('''
       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
           id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
           name TEXT,
           age INTEGER
       )
   ''')

   # Commit the changes to the database
   connection.commit()
   ```

4. **Insert data into the table:**
   You can insert data into the table using the `INSERT INTO` statement.

   ```python
   cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ("John Doe", 25))

   # Commit the changes to the database
   connection.commit()
   ```

5. **Query data:**
   Retrieve data from the table using the `SELECT` statement.

   ```python
   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
   rows = cursor.fetchall()

   for row in rows:
       print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Age: {row[2]}")
   ```

6. **Update and delete data:**
   You can use the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements to modify or remove data from the table.

   ```python
   # Update
   cursor.execute("UPDATE users SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'John Doe'")

   # Delete
   cursor.execute("DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe'")

   # Commit the changes to the database
   connection.commit()
   ```

7. **Close the connection:**
   Make sure to close the connection when you're done using it.

   ```python
   connection.close()
   ```

That's a basic overview of using SQLite with Python. Just like in Ruby, handle errors appropriately and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
